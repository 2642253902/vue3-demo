vue-project
This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

Recommended IDE Setup
VSCode + Volar (and disable Vetur).

Type Support for .vue Imports in TS
TypeScript cannot handle type information for .vue imports by default, so we replace the tsc CLI with vue-tsc for type checking. In editors, we need Volar to make the TypeScript language service aware of .vue types.

Customize configuration
See Vite Configuration Reference.
